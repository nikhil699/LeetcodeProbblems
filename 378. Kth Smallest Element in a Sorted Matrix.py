# Intuition / Approach (Min Heap Method - O(k log n))
# Since the matrix is sorted row-wise and column-wise, the smallest element is at (0,0), and its neighbors (0,1) and (1,0) are the next smallest.

# We use a min heap to always get the next smallest element.

# Initially, push (matrix[0][0], 0, 0) in the heap.

# Then, pop k elements from the heap â€” on each pop, push the next element from the same column (downward) if not already visited.
