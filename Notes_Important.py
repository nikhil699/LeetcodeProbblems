How would you design a realtime scalable gaming dashboard? 🎮📊

The biggest challenge?

➡️ Realtime updates — As soon as a player's score changes, the system should reflect it immediately.

➡️ Low-latency aggregations — Metrics like total score, number of wins, and time played should be fast to query.

➡️ Scalability — The system should handle millions of users without slowing down.

Can we just use a single database?
Sure — it keeps things simple with a single source of truth.
BUT reading and writing from the same DB + running aggregations = 🚫 not scalable.

How about Master/Replica setup?
Say we use DynamoDB as the main DB and its replica for reads.
Works well for ingestion, but still struggles with aggregations.

✅ The Solution?
We can leverage Redis for low-latency lookups…
…but it's not ideal for complex queries. Let me know which one?

Instead, consider Rockset.
Think of it like a GSI, but optimized for real-time analytics — perfect for joins + aggregations + ingestion.

By separating reads from writes, we essentially follow the CQRS pattern —
One path for fast ingestion, another for fast querying.

💬 Curious to hear your thoughts —
Which DB would you choose for realtime analytics?



𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝟭: Screening Round (DP – Hard Level)
- One Dynamic Programming question split into two challenging subparts
- Both parts required complete code solutions with optimal complexity
- Had to provide time and space complexity analysis and justify the approach
- No hand-holding, expected to arrive at edge cases and optimizations independently

𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝟮: Coding Round 1 (DP + Binary Search)
2-part DSA round
- Part 1: Dynamic Programming (state design + transitions)
- Part 2: Binary Search on answer space (e.g., “Minimize max pages” type patterns)
- Follow-ups included space optimization and identifying trade-offs
- Heavy emphasis on writing clean, modular code and explaining reasoning in real time

𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝟯: Coding Round 2 (Graph – Multi-Component)
Focused on solving a graph-based problem involving multi-component traversal
- Required identifying and handling connected components using BFS/DFS
- Follow-up involved optimizing traversal logic and handling large-scale input efficiently
Interviewer assessed:
- Clarity in explaining traversal strategy
- Ability to handle edge cases and disconnected graphs
- Clean, modular code and real-time debugging
- Clear verbal walkthrough of approach and decisions


𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝟰: System Design + Domain Deep Dive
🔹 Part 1: Domain Knowledge & Ownership
Walkthrough of past projects from previous company
Covered:
- Architecture decisions and tech stack rationale
- Cross-team collaboration and stakeholder alignment
- Impact metrics: latency improvements, cost savings, usage growth
- Scenarios highlighting individual contribution vs. team effort
🔹 Part 2: System Design Part
Design a Booking service like Book My Show.
- API & Data Model: search shows, reserve/confirm/cancel booking; tables: Shows, Seats, Reservations, Transactions
- Concurrency: optimistic vs. pessimistic locking; prevent double-book
- Throughput: cache show details; rate-limit attempts
- Fault Tolerance: idempotent requests with tokens; auto-release holds on timeout
- Edge Cases: payment partial success; sold-out mid-flow; hold expirations
- Observability: success rate, avg. reservation time; alerts on errors, deadlocks
- Scalability: partition seats by auditorium; horizontal service scaling
- Security: JWT auth; role-based access (admins vs. users)





100 GB customer table is taking 30 seconds to fetch last month's orders (even with proper indexing)

Customers are complaining for slow response times 



Solution: Data Partitioning

Data partitioning divides large tables into smaller, manageable pieces called partitions within a single database server


Benefits

- Each partition contains a subset of your data, allowing the database to access only relevant sections instead of scanning entire tables

- Enables partition-level backup and restore operations

- Minimizes memory usage by loading only required partitions


Types of Partitioning Strategies

1. Range Partitioning -> Divides data based on value ranges (dates, IDs, amounts)

2. Hash Partitioning -> Uses hash functions to distribute data evenly across partitions

3. List Partitioning -> Groups data based on predefined discrete values



🤔 over to you, which partitioning strategy should we use to split Customer Table?
