Top 20 System Design Concepts You Should Know

1 - Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across multiple servers for reliability and availability.
2 - Caching: Stores frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.
3 - Database Sharding: Splits databases to handle large-scale data growth.
4 - Replication: Copies data across replicas for availability and fault tolerance.
5 - CAP Theorem: Trade-off between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
6 - Consistent Hashing: Distributes load evenly in dynamic server environments.
7 - Message Queues: Decouples services using asynchronous event-driven architecture.
8 - Rate Limiting: Controls request frequency to prevent system overload.
9 - API Gateway: Centralized entry point for routing API requests.
10 - Microservices: Breaks systems into independent, loosely coupled services.
11 - Service Discovery: Locates services dynamically in distributed systems.
12 - CDN: Delivers content from edge servers for speed.
13 - Database Indexing: Speeds up queries by indexing important fields.
14 - Data Partitioning: Divides data across nodes for scalability and performance.
15 - Eventual Consistency: Guarantees consistency over time in distributed databases
16 - WebSockets: Enables bi-directional communication for live updates.
17 - Scalability: Increases capacity by upgrading or adding machines.
18 - Fault Tolerance: Ensures system availability during hardware/software failures.
19 - Monitoring: Tracks metrics and logs to understand system health.
20 - Authentication & Authorization: Controls user access and verifies identity securely.

Nosql/Couchbase/Mongo DB

But choosing between 2 good options is quite hard, that’s what it’s all about.

Your design choices depend on:

- scalability goals
- latency sensitivity
- security requirements
- the business and budget
- data migration strategies
- the team and the skill sets
- disaster recovery strategies
- peak load handling capacity
- the deployment environment
- geographic distribution needs
- third-party service integrations
- customization and extensibility
- integration with existing systems
- multitenancy and isolation levels
- API dependencies and limitations
- versioning and rollback capabilities
- compliance with industry standards
- internationalization and localization
- environmental sustainability concerns
- user authentication and authorization

Every problem and system will be different, so you can practice good approaches with questions.

But in the end, you have to make choices that ultimately make a better system.

See it as a series of sacrifices you’ll make for an efficient system.

The explanation of these choices is how you clear system design each time.


#/*
#Given:
#A string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters only

#Problem:
#Find the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with the characters of the string

#Example:
#Input: s = "aabccccddd"
#Output: 9
#accdbdcca
#*/
#aaab
#baaa
#a = ""
#length = 0
#s = "aabccccddd"
#a = "a"

def palindromString(input):
    inputString = []
    maxCount = 0
    
    for character in range(0,len(input)):
        inputString.append(input[character])
        if inputString.reverse() == inputString:
            maxCount = max(maxCount,len(inputString))
            
    
    return maxCount
        
    
    
input = "aabccccddd"
print(palindromString(input))
