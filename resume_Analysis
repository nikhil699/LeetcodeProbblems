Feedback of Resume
Resume highlights relevant backend experience and technical stack, which is well-aligned with your aspirations.
Clear mention of projects at Lloyds Technology Center and Mphasis helps to validate practical exposure.
Project details are described reasonably but lack quantifiable impact for several points.
Usage of terminology and acronyms (TRIAD, OCIS, Fiserv) assumes the reader's prior knowledge—could be clarified.
The structure and flow of the resume satisfactorily showcases main contributions in each role.
Skills section could be more prominently placed and categorized (e.g., Languages, Frameworks, Cloud, Tooling).
Lacks easily scannable achievements or recognition points, such as awards or significant milestones.
Experience in monitoring and troubleshooting in production environments is highlighted.


Areas of Improvement in Resume
Use more quantifiable outcomes for each achievement or project (e.g., increased uptime by X%, reduced errors by Y%).
Clarify less common terms, acronyms, or company-specific jargon for broader readability.
Summarize key contributions in bullet points to make highlights stand out.
Include concise, descriptive headers and possibly a short summary/profile at the top.
Consider reordering to show technical skills and tools more clearly near the top.
Add a section for relevant certifications or courses if applicable to enhance credibility.



Feedback on Skills and Technical Depth for Desired Role
Familiarity with enterprise-grade microservices, spring ecosystem, and cloud (GCP) aligns well with MNC backend roles.
Used resilience patterns like Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j), demonstrates awareness of production reliability practices.
Hands-on experience with observability tools like Dynatrace and Prometheus meets the expected DevOps and operational readiness for large companies.
Can discuss testing, validation, and response optimization strategies, including async, caching, and indexing, which are key to performance engineering.
Exposure to third-party service integration and API reliability strategies is a plus.
Experience with ML-powered systems (MuSE project) suggests flexibility, though details remain too high-level for deep technical scrutiny.
Sample answers sometimes lacked depth in architectural or data consistency concerns (e.g., transactional strategy, cache invalidation specifics).
Could better articulate validation and fallback logic for mission-critical systems—explanations were somewhat surface-level.


Areas of Improvement in Skills and Technical Depth for Desired Role
Deepen design and architectural knowledge (e.g., distributed transactions, eventual consistency, CAP theorem) as these are often probed at top MNC backend interviews.
Be more precise about cache strategies (TTL, eviction, write-through vs write-back, cache-busting scenarios).
Practice articulating approaches to monitoring, alerting, and root-cause diagnosis with concrete real-world examples.
Strengthen understanding and explanation of language detection/translation systems—interviewers may dig further into edge cases or fallback mechanisms.
Simulate more in-depth system design and troubleshooting discussions, as required by hiring managers at Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
Add more quantifiable impact and stronger narrative around your individual contribution to complex projects.
Consider hands-on practice on open-ended backend design problems to boost confidence and articulation.


(1) how you make sure consistency and isolatoion in your application
(2) What tools are you using for monitoring and analisis
(3) how you got to know that you have this issue ( Optimized API performance and database queries, resulting in a 40% reduction in response times and ensuring 99.99%
system uptime during peak periods.)
(4) Used in-memory caching where applicable to improve performance and reduce redundant external service calls.
