# Interview Questions -  ✅ What is the Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface — Interview Style

# Sir, in my project I used both abstract classes and interfaces depending on the requirement. If I wanted to define common behavior with some shared code, I used an abstract class. But when I wanted to define a contract with no implementation, I used an interface.

# 🔹 Abstract Class:
# 👉 Can have both abstract and non-abstract (implemented) methods.
# 👉 Can have constructors, instance variables.
# 👉 Used when classes share common code.

# Example : 👇 
# abstract class Animal {
#  void eat() {
#  System.out.println("Animal is eating");
#  }
#  abstract void sound();
# }

# 🔹 Interface:
# 👉 All methods are abstract by default (till Java 7).
# 👉 From Java 8 onwards, it can have default and static methods.
# 👉 No constructors or instance variables (only constants).
# 👉 Used when multiple classes need to follow the same rule/contract.

# Example : 👇
# interface Flyable {
#  void fly();
# }

# 🔧 How I used it in my project:
# 👉 In my microservice project, I used an interface for the UserService to define the method signatures like getUser() and createUser() — and created multiple implementations for testing and production.

# 👉 I used an abstract class for BaseController to keep common logic like response formatting and error handling.

# ✅ One-Line Summary:
# Sir, I used abstract class when I needed shared logic among subclasses, and interface when I wanted to define just a contract that different classes should follow.





# Interview Questions - ✅SynchronizedMap vs. ConcurrentHashMap — Interview Style Answer
# (Me) :- Sir, in one of my projects, I had to make a map thread-safe because multiple threads were reading and writing at the same time. At first, I used a SynchronizedMap, but later I moved to ConcurrentHashMap for better performance.

# 🔹 SynchronizedMap:
# 👉 It's basically a normal map (like HashMap) wrapped with synchronization.
# 👉 Only one thread can access the map at a time — full map gets locked.
# 👉 Good for simple use, but slow in high-concurrency environments.

# Map<String, String> map = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());

# 🔹 ConcurrentHashMap:
# 👉 It's specially designed for high-performance, multi-threaded environments.
# 👉 Instead of locking the whole map, it divides the map into segments and only locks part of it.
# 👉 Multiple threads can read/write simultaneously without blocking each other much.
# 👉 Much faster and scalable than SynchronizedMap.

# ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

# ✅ When I used what:
# When performance was not a big issue, I used SynchronizedMap. But when many threads were hitting the map (like in login sessions or real-time data updates), I used ConcurrentHashMap — it handled concurrency better and gave better speed.

# 🧠 One-Line Summary:
# SynchronizedMap locks the whole map, while ConcurrentHashMap allows multiple threads to work on it at the same time — so it’s faster and better for high-concurrency use cases.

# But because they can’t explain how they handle exceptions in a clean, structured way.

# Here’s a simple way to talk about it — and stand out instantly 👇

# 1. Centralized handling

# Don’t repeat exception logic in every controller.
# Set up a global handler that catches and formats all exceptions in one place.

# This makes your code cleaner — and much easier to debug or change later.

# 2. Use custom exceptions

# Anyone can throw a generic error.
# But custom exceptions show that you’re designing your app for clarity.

# In one of my early projects, switching to named exceptions helped us trace bugs 10x faster during integration testing.


# 3. Structured error response

# Think like the frontend dev.

# Instead of sending raw errors, send a consistent structure:
# timestamp, message, status code, and endpoint path.

# Makes debugging faster and logs more readable.

# You don’t have to over-engineer it.
# But you do need a system that works — and you need to be able to explain it clearly.
