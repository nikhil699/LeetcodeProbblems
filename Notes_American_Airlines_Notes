You might fail your next Java interview — not because you don't know the concepts... but because you didn’t expect these questions.

I walked into a Spring Boot interview last year feeling confident.

5 years of experience. Dozens of services built but still got stuck. 
 
They were about real-life scenarios. 
The kind you only learn when you’ve been burned in production.

Here are medium-level scenario-based Java + Spring Boot questions that come up way more often than you'd expect — and can trip up even experienced developers:

1. How would you debug a memory leak in a Spring Boot microservice? 

Hint: They want more than "check the logs.
Talk about heap dumps, analyzing with tools like VisualVM, finding large collections or caches that never get cleared.

2. What happens if one `@Transactional` method calls another `@Transactional` method in the same class? 

Spoiler: The second transaction may be ignored because of Spring's proxy-based AOP. They want to know if you understand self-invocation issues.

3. You added caching with `@Cacheable`, but it's not working. What could go wrong?

This is about Spring's proxy mechanism again. 
Common issues: method is `private`, called internally, or caching is misconfigured.

4. How do you handle circular dependencies in Spring?

They want to know your strategies — using setter injection, `@Lazy`, or refactoring design to break the cycle.

5. A REST API intermittently fails with 500 errors under load. How do you find and fix it?

Think like an SRE: thread dumps, analyze logs, look for blocking code, DB bottlenecks, connection pool exhaustion, etc.

6. Your scheduled task in Spring Boot doesn’t run. Why?

Missed `@EnableScheduling`? Running as a non-bean? Wrong cron? 
These questions test if you actually used these annotations — not just read about them.

7. What happens when you use `@Autowired` on a field vs constructor vs setter?

This isn't just preference — it's about testability, immutability, and control over injection.

(3) so your team is developing a microservices based application and there is an requirement to implement cross cotting concern so how we are going to maintain cross cutting concern and how many types of crooss cutting concern
what is the use of cross cutting concerns.




(4) suppose your team is deploying a microservices into production and there is need to implement circuit breaker pattern so may be you need to handle the failures and after failures what you are going to do.
so there is how many retry mechnaism and how we are going to apply retry mechnism
there is concept odf half open and half closed




(5) so normally your teams needs to implement a multi tenancy architehture in a spring applicattion to support multiple clients with a isloted data and a configuration as well
so how would you design and implement a multi tenancy solution.
databases seperate, configuration files ( in terms of coding )
multiple datases how you are going to configure and then access
Example : Policybazar





(6) in your application what is the authentication and authorization you are using (JWT Token).what is the mean of refresh token when you are going to do refresh token.
just think you are doing some work and yoiur token got expire and then sequency may not work beacuse token got expire so how you handle this for example you are going to call third party service subsequently request you are sending beacuse comming from your application so in between the token got expire by third party service so you are in middle so the next request you are sending and token got expire.
suppose you are doing some payment and token got expire and is this being a correct way so may be our user got frustated because of this.
so what is the solution for this ?
its take thirty sec for everyone its a global issue 






(7) so normally in your application implememnt just a multithreaded to the performance and  responsivness and how we are going to do , how we are design your application to avoid the race condition.
Race Condion : when several request try to access the same resurces at a time.

Completable future and callable function ( what is the meaning of this completable future ).






(8) elastic load balancing in AWS . what is the functionality of elastic load balancing.






(9) what is the mean of idempotent in the rest API.
what are the HTTP methods which support idempotent and not support.






(10) in which situation we use SQL nad No SQL.
cant we store blob, images, document in the SQL databases.
how we are going to handle the kind of relationship with no SQL suppose employe Department data and employee based onthe department inside No SQL. 
how we are going to handle relationship among entities in No SQL.




(11) imagine you have a machine learning model deploy in kubernates and the work load incresing significatly how to scale the deployment to handle the increse load.
increse the instances.
increse in the pods different pods




(12) how many types of scaling.(vertical and Horizontal Scaling).

As a Microservices developer,

Please learn:

1. Microservices Architecture Basics: Monolithic vs. Microservices, characteristics (independence, scalability, resilience), and designing microservices boundaries (DDD - Domain-Driven Design).

2. Service Communication: Synchronous (REST, gRPC) vs. Asynchronous (Message Queues), API design and versioning, event-driven architecture, and event sourcing.

3. Data Management: Database per service, distributed data management (saga pattern, 2PC, CQRS), and handling data consistency across services.

4. Deployment Strategies: Containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and service discovery and registry (Eureka, Consul).

5. Frameworks and Tools: Spring Boot (Spring Cloud for microservices), Micronaut, Quarkus, or Dropwizard as alternatives.

6. Communication Protocols: RESTful APIs and gRPC, messaging systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ).

7. Databases: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra), and distributed caching (Redis, Memcached).

8. CI/CD Pipelines: Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and deployment strategies like Blue-Green and Canary deployments.

9. Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible, or AWS CloudFormation.

10. Logging and Monitoring: Centralized logging (ELK Stack, Splunk) and monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana).

11. Resilience and Fault Tolerance: Circuit Breaker (Hystrix, Resilience4j), Bulkhead pattern, and retries.

12. Security: OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and API Gateways (Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong).

13. Testing Microservices: Unit and integration testing, contract testing (Pact), and end-to-end testing.

14. Scalability Patterns: Horizontal and vertical scaling, load balancing (HAProxy, NGINX).

15. Distributed Tracing: Tools like Jaeger and Zipkin.

16. Anti-Patterns: Avoiding distributed monoliths and over-engineering microservices.


HLD: Design a chat system for the Amazon returns team. Here a bot can respond to customers using a predefined workflow and if the customer reaches the end of the bot workflow, then allow an option to chat with a live Amazon returns agent. The customer can add photos and videos to the chat. Considering agents are working from home and an agent goes offline, new agents should see chat history immediately.

We used the invisionapp website for the design diagram, and I did well on this round. My tips for acing the HLD: Have a structured approach and be open to suggestions. Something like:

Start with estimation.
Make assumptions and decide scope.
Come up with a very high-level design
Later, discuss individual components in more detail.

And some tips:

Make sure you are properly communicating your rationale behind every tech decision. Like why use web sockets over long polling? Or why do we choose No-SQL over SQL DB?
Make sure you discuss limitations and bottlenecks and a plan to avoid those if required.
Ask for frequent feedback explicitly and ask if anything specific needs to be discussed before moving on to the next component. And many more, stay tuned for a blog around this.
