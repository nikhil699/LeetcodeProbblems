“Difference between Runnable and Callable Interface and when would you use each?”
 
Both Runnable and Callable interfaces are used to define tasks that can be executed by different threads. The key difference is their capability to return a value or handle exceptions.
 
🔹 Runnable Interface
 
• It contains a single run() method with void return type. The run method cannot return a value to the caller thread. It is ideal for tasks that perform an action but do not need to produce a result.
• It cannot throw checked exceptions and any checked exceptions that occur within the run method must be handled internally.
 
🔹 Callable Interface
 
• It contains a single generic call() method that returns a value. The call() method can return a result of any generic type. This is useful for computational tasks where the result is needed by the main program.
• It can throw checked exceptions.
 
🛠️ When to use each
 
✔ Use Runnable when you need to execute a task asynchronously but do not need to retrieve a result or handle a checked exception. A common use case is running a background task like logging or updating a UI element.
 
✔ Use Callable when a task performs a computation and needs to return a value to the calling thread. It is also the correct choice when the task is likely to throw a checked exception that needs to be handled by the caller. Examples include fetching data from a database or performing a complex calculation.


Notification API will be called
- Then SQS kind of queue. Where you will have multiple priority queue for different type of notifications 
- Workers will pick event from this queue
- Executor will start notifying the users
- Once they received acknowledgement they will send the result to AWS Kinesis.
- Kinesis uses data streaming so basically to avoid database bottleneck
- Datalqke Publisher and DB writer will write result to database
- Scheduler a chron job will pick failed events
- Again process is repeated
