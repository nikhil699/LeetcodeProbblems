# Low-Level Design ‚Üí Focused on core interview-ready problems like a Quiz Platform, Parking Lot System, Rate Limiter, 
# and Multithreaded Task Scheduler in Java. Emphasized clean OOP, SOLID principles, design patterns, 
# and proper concurrency handling ‚Äî practiced consistently, not just before interviews.


# ‚Ä¢ Behavioral Rounds ‚Üí Gave them equal weight. Prepared well-structured stories 
# for real scenarios ‚Äî conflict resolution, taking ownership, and learnings from failure. 
# These rounds can absolutely impact the final decision.


# ‚Ä¢ DSA with Patterns ‚Üí Prioritized depth over volume. Revisited core patterns like DP, 
# Union-Find, and Sliding Window until I could solve confidently. Categorized problems by technique ‚Äî not 
# just solving for the sake of it.
# Round 2: LLD + System Design + SQL
# I was asked to explain the architecture and design decisions of the projects I worked on at my previous company.
# Follow-up questions included:
#  ‚öôÔ∏è How did you handle configuration management and service-to-service communication?
#  üìà What challenges did you face in scaling?
#  üîÑ How did you handle failures and retries in distributed systems?
#  üß† Where did you use caching and what kind

# 1st I was asked about OOPS concept.
# 2nd I was asked abstract class, its implementation, etc.
# Then I was asked how Abstract class is different from interface and to implement interface.
# Then, some code snippets were given to me and I was asked for code-pair and do some operations on abstract class 
# and interfaces examples. This was very complex to be honest and java concepts to the core were tested here. 
# Then, I was asked if 2 interfaces can be implemented by abstract.
# Next, I was asked to implement polymorphism.
# Then threading in java was asked and was to create the thread(extending the class, implementing runnable 
# interface, implementing callable).
# Then, a LLD snapshot was given and I was given api contracts, I had to design models their data-types, 
# repository, service and controller(only pseudo-code was asked). Then, I was asked to use SQL for data implementation 
# as earlier I was using in-memory storage.
