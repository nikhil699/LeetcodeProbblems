#(1) You are given an array of integers, height, of length n. Each element in the array 
# represents the height of a vertical line drawn at the corresponding index, where the 
# line extends from the point (i, 0) to (i, height[i]).
# Your task is to determine two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container 
# that can hold the maximum amount of water. Return the largest possible amount of water that can be 
# contained within the container formed by these two lines.







#(2) A robot is positioned at the top-left corner of an m x n grid and needs to move to the bottom-right corner. 
# At each step, the robot can only move either down or right. Given the dimensions of the grid (m and n), 
# calculate how many distinct paths the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

# m=3 n=7

#(3) Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

#The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.
#Input: s = "IceCreAm"

#Output: "AceCreIm"
#Nausheen Siddiqui to Everyone (12:39â€¯PM)
#Input: s = "leetcode"

#Output: "leotcede"
#Input: m = 3, n = 7
#Output: 28


#Input: m = 3, n = 2
#Output: 3

# nput: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
maxArea = height[0]
for i in range(1,len(height)):
    maxArea = max(maxArea, height[i])
