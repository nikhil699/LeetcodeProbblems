These questions, categorised based on Read-Heavy and Write-Heavy systems are a must-solve before your next Senior-Level interview at top PBCs like MAANG-M (plus there’s notes on what each question really evaluates) 👇

🔸 Read-Heavy Systems
These test your ability to scale while minimizing latency and handling high read loads.

1. Design a URL Shortener (Bitly)
→ Focus: unique ID generation, collision handling, database schema
→ Scale tips: add caching, rate limits, DB sharding

2. Design an Image Hosting Service
→ Focus: object storage (S3/GCS), CDN, image deduplication
→ Add: thumbnail generation, access control, rate limiting

3. Design a Social Media Platform (Twitter/Facebook)
→ Focus: posts, timelines, user relationships (follows/friends)
→ Scale tips: denormalized storage, fanout logic, partitioning strategy

4. Design a NewsFeed System (Advanced)
→ Focus: push vs pull models, ranking logic, user-specific feeds
→ Add: caching layers, pagination, handling spikes in traffic

🔸 Write-Heavy Systems
These systems test your durability, ingestion speed, real-time processing, and consistency trade-offs

1. Rate Limiter
→ Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket algorithm
→ Redis counters, TTLs, and circuit breakers

2. Log Collection & Analysis System
→ Kafka for ingestion, ELK stack for processing
→ Discuss buffering, partitions, and real-time querying

3. Voting System
→ Handle duplicate votes, ensure idempotency
→ Design for real-time vs eventual aggregation

4. Trending Topics System
→ Count-min sketch for approximations
→ Use sliding window techniques and ranking models




HLD : Build  a hotel Search and booking system.

Just had one of the toughest microservices interviews of my career.
It wasn’t about writing @RestController — it was about real-world architecture, scalability, and resilience.

Here are some advanced questions I faced (and you might too):

🔹 Distributed Caching: How would you design a caching strategy across multiple services to prevent stale data?

🔹 Saga Pattern: Can you explain how you’d implement orchestration vs. choreography for long-running transactions?

🔹 Event-Driven Architecture: How do you ensure exactly-once processing in Kafka (or similar message brokers)?

🔹 API Gateway Challenges: How do you handle rate limiting, request throttling, and security policies at scale?

🔹 Data Partitioning: How would you design a sharded database strategy for millions of requests per day?

🔹 Service Mesh: Why use a service mesh (like Istio/Linkerd) over traditional load balancers and what trade-offs come with it?

🔹 Observability: How do you implement distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin) and connect it with metrics (Prometheus/Grafana) for debugging latency issues?

🔹 Resiliency Testing: How do you approach chaos engineering in microservices? Any real example you tried?

🔹 Deployment Strategies: Compare Blue-Green vs. Canary deployments — when would you pick one over the other?





🚀My Interview Experience

I recently attended an interview for a Java Backend Developer position at one of the companies.

🔹 3rd Round – Advanced Technical
_________________________________________

1. How have you used Spring Security in your project?
2. What is a Spring Boot profile, and how did you use it?
3. What is exception handling, and what is an advisor?
4. How does the @Transactional annotation work?
5. Explain microservices architecture
6. What is Kafka and how have you implemented it?

Here’s one of the practical questions they might throw at you:
“How would you design a distributed backup system that avoids backing up the same data again and again?”

Think beyond basics:
 ✅ Use content-defined chunking — smartly split files to detect small changes
 ✅ Generate fingerprints (hashes) to identify duplicate chunks
 ✅ Store unique chunks only once across all backups
 ✅ Build scalable indexing — maybe using bloom filters or sharded stores

All to ensure storage efficiency without sacrificing recovery speed.

But let’s talk trade-offs —
 What happens if two backup jobs hit the same file at the same time?
 ❓ Do you lock writes?
 ❓ Go lock-free but clean up later?

Rubrik interviews often explore these edge cases — your choices and your fallbacks.

So...
